# Term-Deposit-Subscription-Prediction
 This repository provides code and resources for predicting term deposit subscriptions using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information about whether clients subscribed to a term deposit ("yes" or "no"). Explore various machine learning models and techniques for predicting client subscriptions to enhance marketing strategies and improve campaign effectiveness.

## Bank client data:
- age (numeric)
- job: type of job (categorical : "admin", "bluecollar", "entrepreneur", "housemaid", "management", "retired", "selfemployed", "services", "student", "technician", "unemployed", "unknown").
- marital: marital status (categorical: "divorced","married","single","unknown"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
- education: education of individual (categorical: "basic.4y", "basic.6y", "basic.9y", "high.school", "illiterate", "professional.course", "university.degree","unknown")
- default: has credit in default? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
- housing: has housing loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
- loan: has personal loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")

### Related with the last contact of the current campaign:
- contact: contact communication type (categorical: "cellular","telephone")
- month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", â€¦, "nov", "dec")
- dayofweek: last contact day of the week (categorical: "mon","tue","wed","thu","fri")
- duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y="no"). Yet, the duration is not known 
  before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the - intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

### Other attributes:
- campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
- pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
- previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
- poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "failure","nonexistent","success")
  Social and economic context attributes
- emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
  cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
- cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
  concave points_se: standard error for number of concave portions of the contour
- euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
- nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

### Output variable (desired target):
- y: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")
